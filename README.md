# Silvermine TypeScript Configuration

## What?

Shareable [TypeScript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
files for all Silvermine projects.


## Why?

The TypeScript compiler has [many options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)
that affect everything from the constructs that are allowed in a project's
TypeScript code to the format of the JavaScript that the compiler outputs.
Storing this configuration in a single place helps ensure our settings are
consistent across projects.
